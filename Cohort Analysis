Cohort Analysis is one of the best methods of tracking the behavior of user engagement. A cohort means people with similar traits that are treated as a group.
This analysis basically breaks down users into different groups instead of analyzing them as a whole unit. One example would be putting users who have become customers at approximately the same time into one group or cohort.
This technique is used to make it easier and more convenient for businesses and organizations to detect patterns among the lifecycles of their user groups. Theyâ€™re able to isolate these patterns, allowing them to properly analyze and understand better the behavior of a user in a certain cohort
